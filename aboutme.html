      <h1> About Me </h1>
       <p> I am working towards going to college to get a good education and degree but also to become a d1 soccer player. My experience from my travel club team has really grown my passion for the sport so I want to accomplish bigger goals and things in college for that sport as well.

2.How I will get to my goal is going to require a lot of hard work on and off the field. I will make sure to get good grades and maintain those good grades throughout high school. I'm going to train extra hard and improve in soccer over the years.

3.What values I consider most necessary to reach my goal is definitely rely on god and keep my faith strong. He's what gets me through anything and everything. I also think that training is most important to get to my goal.

4. Some short term goals of mine would be to become faster and more in shape than I already am. Also to get good grades this quarter. I also want to make the ECNL team again this year.
